## 📁 Dataset
- Previous year question papers (text or extracted from PDF)
- Annotated with metadata: Subject, Year, Unit, Type (Midterm/Final)

---

## 📈 Approach
1. Preprocess and clean historical question data
2. Extract features (keywords, topics)
3. Train ML models to learn question patterns
4. Predict likely questions based on trends
5. Display predictions and analytics to the user
