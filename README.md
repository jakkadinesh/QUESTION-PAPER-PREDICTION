📚 Question Paper Prediction Using Machine Learning
🔍 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting potential questions for upcoming exams by analyzing patterns from previous years' question papers using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It aims to assist students and educators in identifying important topics and likely questions, improving preparation efficiency.

🚀 Features
🧠 Machine Learning-based prediction of likely exam questions
📊 Analysis of topic frequency and trends over past papers
📝 Text classification and topic modeling
🧹 Preprocessing of historical question papers (PDF/text)
📈 Visualization of topic trends and question weights
🧪 Model training and evaluation
🌐 Web interface (optional) for user-friendly access to predictions

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
NLP (NLTK / spaCy / Transformers)
PDF/Text Parsing (PyMuPDF, PDFMiner, etc.)
Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
(Optional) Flask / Streamlit for frontend

📁 Dataset
Historical question papers collected from university/college archives
Dataset includes subjects, years, and paper types (midterm, final, etc.)

🧪 Model Approach
Text preprocessing (tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization)
Feature extraction using TF-IDF / BERT embeddings
Classification or clustering to group similar questions
Trend analysis across years to identify frequently asked topics
Final prediction using trained ML model (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, or Neural Networks)

🧑‍🎓 Use Cases
Students: Focus study efforts on frequently asked topics
Teachers: Identify coverage gaps in previous assessments
Institutions: Curriculum review and planning

📝 Future Work
Add deep learning models (e.g., BERT, LSTM)
Include visual dashboard for predictions
Deploy full-stack web application
Expand dataset for more robust predictions
